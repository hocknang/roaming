Good morning/afternoon, I’m [Name] from [MOM].
Opening:
Ever wondered how employment disputes used to be handled? Would you spare me 2-3mins of your time to share our transformation journey with you?
 Not long ago, if someone had a dispute—say, over unpaid salary—they will have to wait for a few days just to get basic advice. Filing a case meant filling out forms from scratch,  and waiting weeks for a court date.
But we’ve transformed this process from start to finish.
Slide 2:
First, if customer need advice on their case, they no longer have to wait days to speak to an officer. With our in-house chatbot, customers can get quick, accurate guidance whenever it’s needed most. If their queries are not answered, there will be options to then speak to an officer, all done online. 
Second, if customer needs to file a case with us, it will no longer have to be tedious and cumbersome. Today, our platform integrates Singpass to simplify form-filling, helping customers focus on their cases without added hassle.
Third, dispute resolution process. Previously customers have to wait 2-3 weeks after the filing of their case to meet with our officer and their respondents. Today, our e-Negotiation platform allows disputes to be resolved online, often eliminating the need for a physical meeting altogether. In the first version of this process, customers discuss their case with their employers through a simple chat function. Fast forward to the present, our latest model has intelligent features and resources to help parties resolve their dispute privately among themselves.
Slide 3:
Our online platform, EmPOWER, now covers every step of the dispute resolution journey—without anyone needing to come to our service center.
Slide 4:
Even as we move forward in our digitalisation journey, a key anchor for us was not to lose the human touch in our interaction with our customers. Hence, we relied on the principles on this slide to ensure we not lose sight of serving our customers with heart.
Slide 5:
This slide showcases the key features of our online platform. Will you be interested to know more? Is there any particular feature you think could be used in your organisation? Do stop by our booth to hear from our colleagues who will be more than happy to share with you!

Slide 6:
Our chatbot is called Ask TADM. For if you ask, you will be answered. These are the standout features of our chatbot
-	Personalised user experience: Ask for your employment profile before dishing our relevant advice under the Employment Act.
-	E-Advisory: Remembers your profile and gives the enquirer specific advice to their questions.
-	Self-help calculators: Inbuilt formulas under the Employment Act, customer don’t have to know which formula to use for their scenario.
-	Validity Assessment: Checks for the claim eligibility according to law and time period
-	Seamless appt making: For complex enquires, it will prompt customer to make an appointment for further clarification.
-	Seamless claim filing: No more form filling from the start. With the inputs from the queries plus information from Singpass, information will be pre-populated so that filing will be a breeze.
Slide 7:
e-Negotiation – the engine which empowers self-resolution between the employee and employer.
Turn-based dialogue: Instead of a unstructured free flow dialogue, a turn based mechanism instil clarity and focussed discussion on the matter at hand.
Intelligent prompts: A key ingredient in resolving the claim is the applying the law to their specific scenarios. Our e-Negotiation engine picks up inputs from parties from each turn and provides relevant prompts to inform and nudge parties for settlement.
Respectful communication: Resolution will not be possible if parties are emotionally charged and express it through spiteful and negative words. Our e-Negotiation engine has a inbuilt Sentiment Analysis which detects and nudge parties to keep their conversation civic and constructive.
Formula based computation: Often, parties are just disputing on the ways of calculating their claims. To solve that, we inbuilt e-calculators which are tied to their claims, so that they know how they should calculate their claims instead of reducing the conversation to a market bargain.
Automated Payment Monitoring: Once parties have reached an agreement, the last step of the process will be payment. With dashboard tracking, officers no longer have to track the cases, system will automatically send reminders when a task is due and close the case once the claimant has updated the receipt of payment.
